# AdventureWorks Retail Performance Analysis with BigQuery

This project queries key retail business metrics from the [AdventureWorks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure) dataset using advanced SQL techniques on **Google BigQuery**.

---

## Objective

- Write reusable SQL queries that serve as building blocks for business reporting
- Transform raw transactional data into metric-focused summaries as requested by business stakeholders
- Demonstrate practical SQL techniques used in real business contexts

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Techniques

- **BigQuery SQL**: CTEs, window functions (`LAG`, `RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`), date functions, aggregations, joins
- **Dataset**: `adventureworks2019` (Sales, Production, Purchasing)
- Time-based aggregation (monthly/yearly)
- Ranking and performance comparison
- Cohort logic based on first occurrence
