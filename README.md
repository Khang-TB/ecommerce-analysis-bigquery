# E-commerce User Behavior Query Project (BigQuery)

This project includes a set of structured SQL queries developed in **Google BigQuery** to extract behavioral and performance metrics from the `google_analytics_sample` dataset.

The queries are designed as modular building blocks to support BI reporting on session engagement, traffic source effectiveness, and conversion funnel steps.

## How to Use

1. Open the file `ecommerce_user_behavior_bigquery.sql` in Google BigQuery.  
2. Run each query independently depending on the metric of interest. The dataset is publicly available via Google Cloud (`bigquery-public-data`).
3. You can adapt queries for other months, traffic segments, or KPIs as needed.

> Note: This project focused on logic and metric extraction only. This is not a full analysis.
